        <p>I have lived on Pulaski Street for almost three years. On my specific block, there is an empty lot filled with grass that many street cats call home! </p>
        <p>These cats are mainly cared for by a woman on my block who has consistently given these cats food, water, and vet vists - likely for much longer than I've been on the block. With that being said, the names I have given the cats are of my own creation, for my own amusement.</p>
        <p >This directory allows you to explore all my findings as I have gotten to know these feline friends =^-^=</p>
